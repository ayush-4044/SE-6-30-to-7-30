Module 2 – Introduction to Programming 

1). Overview of C Programming :- 

1.1) Write an essay covering the history and evolution of C programming. Explain its importance and why it is still used today.

- C programming language is one of the most used programming languages in computer science. C is important because it is fast, efficient, and portable, forming the base for many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python. It is still used today in operating systems, embedded systems, and compilers due to its speed and close-to-hardware control.

2). Setting Up Environment :- 

2.1)  Describe the steps to install a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like DevC++, VS Code, or CodeBlocks.
 
- Install MinGW (Recommended for VS Code or Command Line).

Step 1 - Go to the official MinGW website:

 	- https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

Step 2 - Click Download MinGW.

Step 3 - After installation, open MinGW Installer.

Step 4 -  In the list, check:

	- mingw32-gcc-g++

	- mingw32-gcc-objc

Step 5 - Click Installation → Apply Changes.

Step 6 - After installation, open This PC → Properties → Advanced System Settings → Environment Variables.

Step 7 - Under “System Variables”, find and select Path, then click Edit.

Step 8 - Click New, and add:     

	- C:\MinGW\bin

Step 9 - Click OK to save.

- To verify installation:

- Open Command Prompt and type:    gcc --version

3). Basic Structure of a C Program :-

3.1)  Explain the basic structure of a C program, including headers, main function,comments, data types, and variables. Provide examples. 

1). Header Files : Header files contain predefined functions that can be used in your program. 
2). Main function : main() is nothing but a function, the program starts executing from main().
3). Comments : Comments are used to explian a code and improve readability.
4). Data types : Data type define what kind of value variable can store.
5). Variables : Variables are used to store data.

- Example : 

#include <stdio.h>        // 1. Header file
#include<conio.h>

// 2. Comments
/* This is a simple C program that displays values of variables */

int main()                // 3. Main function (program execution starts here)
{
    // 4. Variable declaration
    int age = 20;         // 5. integer data type
    float salary = 35000.50;  // float data type
    char grade = 'A';     // character data type

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Salary: %.2f\n", salary);
    printf("Grade: %c\n", grade);

    getch();
}

4). Operators in C :-

4.1) Write notes explaining each type of operator in C: arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, increment/decrement, bitwise, and conditional operators.

=> Arithmetic operator :

- Used to perform mathematical operations.

- addition (+) 
- subtraction (-) 
- multiplication (*)
- divition (/)
- modulus (%) 

=============================================================

=> Relational operator : 

- Used to compare two values and return either true(1) or false(0). 

- less than (<)
- greater than (>)
- less than or equal to (<=) 
- greater than or equal to (>=) 
- equal to equal to (==)
- not equal to (!=) 

=============================================================

=> Logical operator : 

- Used to combine two or more conditions.

- And (&&)
- Or (||)
- Not (!)

=============================================================

=> Assignment operator : 

- Used to assign values to variables.

- Assign (=) 

=============================================================

=> Increment/Decrement operator : 

- Used to increase or decrease a value by 1.

- Increment (++)
- decrement (--) 

=============================================================

=> Bitwise operator : 

- Used to perform operations on individual bits of integer data.

- AND (&) 
- OR (|) 
- XOR (^) 

=============================================================

=>Conditional Operator : 

- Used as a shortcut for if-else statements.

- condition ? expression1 : expression2;
 
5). Control Flow Statements in C :-

5.1) Explain decision-making statements in C (if, else, nested if-else, switch). Provide examples of each. 

1). if Statement :

- The if statement executes only if the condition is true.

- Example:

 int age = 20;

    if (age >= 18) {
        printf("You are eligible to vote.");
    }

    getch();

==================================================

2). if-else Statement : 

- The if-else statement executes if the condition is true,
and another if the condition is false.

- Example:

 int number = 10;

    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        printf("Even number.");
    } else {
        printf("Odd number.");
    }

    getch();

==================================================

3). Nested if-else Statement : 

- A nested if-else means using an if or else if inside another if.

- Example : 

 int marks = 85;

    if (marks >= 40) {
        if (marks >= 75) {
            printf("Distinction");
        } else {
            printf("Pass");
        }
    } else {
        printf("Fail");
    }

    getch();

==================================================

4). Switch Statement :

- The switch statement is used when you have multiple possible conditions for a single variable.

- Example : 

  int choice;
	
   switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            printf("gujrati");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("hindi");
        default:
            printf("Invalid choice");
    }

    getch();

6). Looping in C :- 

6.1) Compare and contrast while loops, for loops, and do-while loops. Explain the scenarios in which each loop is most appropriate. 

- While Loop : In while loop, The condition is checked first and then running all statements.
- For Loop : In for loop, first do the initialize after checked condition after running statements and then do the increment/decrement.
- Do While Loop : In do while loop, it execute at least once, even if the condition is false.    

- Use of all loop : 

Use "for" when you know the number of repetitions.
Use "while" when the condition depends on runtime input.
Use "do-while" when the loop must run at least once.

7). Loop Control Statements :- 

7.1)  Explain the use of break, continue, and goto statements in C. Provide examples of each. 

=> Break : 

- Break statement is used to exit from loop or switch statement.

- exmaple : 

  void main() {
    int i;
    for(i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if(i == 5)
            break;  
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    getch();
 }

============================================================

=> Continue : 

- Continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to next iteration.

- example : 

  void main() {
    int i;
    for(i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if(i == 5)
            continue;
        printf("%d ", i);
    
    getch();
 }

============================================================

=> Goto : 

- Goto statement is used to jump to label statetment.

- example :

void main() {
    int num = 1;
    
    start: 
    printf("%d ", num);
    num++;
    
    if(num <= 5)
        goto start; 
    
    getch();
}

8). Functions in C :- 

8.1) What are functions in C? Explain function declaration, definition, and how to call a function. Provide examples.

- When you want to reuse the code it is called functions.

- There are two types of functions.

1). Inbuilt functions.
2). User-defined functions.

- Function declaration : return_type function_name (parameter1, parameter2, ....);

- Function definition : return_type function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
   		 // statements
		}

- Function Call : function_name(arguments);

- Example : 

#include <stdio.h>
#iclucde<conio.h>

// Function Declaration
int add(int a, int b);

void main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10, result;

    // Function Call
    result = add(num1, num2);

    printf("Sum = %d\n", result);
    getch();
}

// Function Definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

9). Arrays in C :-

9.1) Explain the concept of arrays in C. Differentiate between one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays with examples. 

- Array : Collection of elements that is called array.

- One dimensional : It is used store data in single row.
- Example :-  int marks[3] = {45, 67, 89};
  		  int i;

   		 printf("Student Marks:\n");
   		 for(i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
     		   printf("%d ", marks[i]);
   		 }

- Multi dimensional : It is used store data in rows and columns.
- Example :- int matrix[2][3] = {
    		    {1, 2, 3},
      		  {4, 5, 6}
 		   };
  		  int i, j;

    		printf("Matrix elements:\n");
    		for(i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      		  for(j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
   		         printf("%d ", matrix[i][j]);
   		     }
      		  printf("\n");
  		  }

10). Pointers in C :-

10.1) Explain what pointers are in C and how they are declared and initialized. Why are pointers important in C? 

- Pointers in C are variables that store the memory address of another variable,declared using (*), initialized using (&) and important for memory management, dynamic data handling and faster execution.

11). Strings in C :-

11.1) Explain string handling functions like strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(), strcmp(), and strchr(). Provide examples of when these functions are useful.

- String handling functions in C include strlen() (finds string length), strcpy() (copies one string to another), strcat() (joins two strings), strcmp() (compares two strings), and strchr() (finds a character in a string).

strlen() – useful to find string length for validation,
strcpy() – to copy user input into another variable,
strcat() – to join first and last name into full name,
strcmp() – to compare login credentials,
strchr() – to search a character like '@' in an email string.

12). Structures in C :- 

12.1) Explain the concept of structures in C. Describe how to declare, initialize, and access structure members. 

- In c structure is a user-defined data type,it is declared using struct keyword,initialized by assigning values to members and access by using 
dot(.) operator.

13). File Handling in C :-

13.1) Explain the importance of file handling in C. Discuss how to perform file operations like opening, closing, reading, and writing files.

- Importance : It is used to save records, read existing data, and handle large data efficiently.

- File open :- Use fopen(),
  FILE *fp;
  fp = fopen("data.txt","w");

- File close :- Use fclose(),
  fclose(fp);

- File write :- Use fprintf() or fwrite(),
  fp = fopen ("data.txt","w");
  fprintf(fp, "Hello World!");

- File read :- Use fscanf() or fread(),
  fp = fopen ("data.txt","r");
  fscanf(fp, "%s",str);
