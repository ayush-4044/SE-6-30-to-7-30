Module #3 Introduction to OOPS Programming 

3.1) Introduction to C++ :-

3.1.1) What are the key differences between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? 

- POP follows a step-by-step procedure and focuses on functions,
while OOP focuses on objects, classes, and real-world modeling.

3.1.2) List and explain the main advantages of OOP over POP.

- OOP gives better code reusability, security (encapsulation), and easier maintenance,
while POP becomes complex and hard to manage for large projects.

3.1.3) Explain the steps involved in setting up a C++ development environment.

- Install a C++ compiler
- Install an IDE/Editor (VS Code/CodeBlocks) 
- Configure compiler path and create your first C++ file.

3.1.4) What are the main input/output operations in C++? Provide examples.

- Input uses cin >> and output uses cout <<.
  Example: cin >> a; and cout << "Hello";.

3.2) Variables, Data Types, and Operators :-

3.2.1) What are the different data types available in C++? Explain with examples.

- Basic types: int, float, double, char, bool
  Example: int a = 10;, char ch = 'A' ,float b = 3.2 ;

3.2.2) Explain the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion in C++.

- Implicit : done automatically by compiler → int x = 5.5;
  Explicit : done manually using cast → float y = (float)10 / 3;

3.2.3) What are the different types of operators in C++? Provide examples of each.

- Arithmetic: + - * / %  
  Example : int a =10, b = 3;
	   cout<< a+b;

- Relational: == != > <
  Example : cout<< (a>b);
 
- Logical: && || !
  Example : int a = 10, b = 20, c = 3;
	   cout<< (a>b && a>c);

- Assignment: = += -=
  Example : a+=5;

- Increment/Decrement: ++ --
  Example : a++; 

- Bitwise: & | ^ ~ << >>
  Example : cout<<(5&3);

3.2.4) Explain the purpose and use of constants and literals in C++.

- Constants store values that cannot change (const int x = 10;).
  Literals are fixed values written directly like 10, 'A', 3.14.

3.3) Control Flow Statements :-

3.3.1) What are conditional statements in C++? Explain the if-else and switch statements.

- Conditional statements decide which block of code runs.
  if-else checks conditions one by one, while switch selects a case based on a single value.

3.3.2) What is the difference between for, while, and do-while loops in C++?

- for is used when number of iterations is known,
  while when condition is checked before loop,
  do-while runs at least once because condition is checked after.

3.3.3) How are break and continue statements used in loops? Provide examples.

- break stops the loop completely,
  continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

3.3.4) Explain nested control structures with an example.

- A control structure (like loop or if) inside another is called nested.
  Example: a loop inside another loop for printing patterns.

3.4) Functions and Scope :-

3.4.1) What is a function in C++? Explain the concept of function declaration, definition, and calling.

- A function is a block of code that performs a task.
  Declaration tells the compiler about the function, definition contains the code, and calling executes the function.

3.4.2) What is the scope of variables in C++? Differentiate between local and global scope.

- Local variables are accessible only inside their function/block.
  Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program.

3.4.3) Explain recursion in C++ with an example.

- Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem.
  Example: factorial function calling itself with smaller values. 

3.4.4) What are function prototypes in C++? Why are they used?

- A function prototype declares a function before its use.
  It is used to tell the compiler the function's name, return type, and parameters before main().

3.5) Arrays and Strings :-

3.5.1) What are arrays in C++? Explain the difference between single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

- Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type stored in continuous memory.

 1D Array (single-dimensional):
 Stores data in a single row (linear form).

 Multi-dimensional Array (2D, 3D…):
 Stores data in rows and columns (matrix form).

3.5.2) Explain string handling in C++ with examples. 

- Strings in C++ are handled using character arrays or the C++ string class.

 Example : char name[10] = "RAM";

3.5.3) How are arrays initialized in C++? Provide examples of both 1D and 2D arrays. 

- 1D array : int a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
  2 D array : int mat[2][2] = {
  		  {1, 2},
		  {3, 4}
		         };

3.5.4) Explain string operations and functions in C++. 

- String length : strlen();
  String lower case : strlwr();
  String upper case : strupr();
  String revers : strrev();
  String concat : strcat();
  String copy : strcpy();
  String comparer : strcmp();

3.6) Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming :-

3.6.1) Explain the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 

- Class 
  Object 
  Abstraction
  Polymorphism
  Inharitance
  Encapsulation

3.6.2) What are classes and objects in C++? Provide an example.

- Class : collection of objects 
  Example : Human body

  Object : Any entity which has own state and behaviour that is called an object.
  Example : pen,paper,chair,table,etc...

3.6.3) What is inheritance in C++? Explain with an example. 

-  when one object acquire all the properties and behaviour of parent class.
  Example : father - son 

3.6.4) What is encapsulation in C++? How is it achieved in classes?

-  wrapping up of data or binding of data.

   How is it achieved	:- Use private data members
		   Access them through public getter/setter functions
